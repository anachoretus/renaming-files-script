# renaming files script

This little script renames _all files in a specified directory and any subdirectories_ to randomised names using Latin letters and digits and preserving original file extensions.
I use this for bulk renaming to anonymise file names before sharing or archiving. 

## features

- renames all files in a directory recursively
- keeps file extensions intact
- generates 16-character alphanumeric names (default)

## warning

- this script _irreversibly_ renames _all_ files in a directory and its subdirectories â€” back up your data first and check carefully which directory you want to run it on
